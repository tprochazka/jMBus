Fraunhofer ISE uses the pts (unix98) version of tty0tty.

When run connect two pseudo-ttys and show the connection names.
  - To run:
         ./tty0tty   
         
         (/dev/pts/1) <=> (/dev/pts/2) 
         
  - Or, with fix aliases, run:       
         ./tty0tty /dev/ttyS99 /dev/ttyS100 
        
         (/dev/ttyS99) <=> (/dev/ttyS100) 

  the connection is (no handshaking!):
  
  TX -> RX
  RX <- TX
